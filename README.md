## Introduction

The goal of this project is to make it easier for music producers to upload their music fast to youtube.

## Technologies

Project has been created using:

* MoviePy version: 1.0.3

## Usage

Open YTMv.exe file. I think it's self explanatory what you need to do next. If the app doesn't work then we probably exceeded youtube API limit for the day. Sorry for that! I'll try to verify my app so I can make my limits bigger.

## Future

In the future I'm planning to add more functionalities such as specifying output folder and more.
